		<h4>Main Problem</h4>
		There were situations when people create danger in public locations, with some involving weapons, and resulting in injuries, deaths, or destruction of property. These situations have created eventually created historical murders, mass homocides and shootings, and arsons, thus shocking the community and endanering the environment. 
		<br>
		People have built visual detection machines or AI image detection programs involving algorithm functions inside physical machines such as security checks or survilance cameras to prevent more of these situations from happening and keep the environment safe. The visual detection machines have been widely used in airports and bus and train stations. In this project, we will be discussing how Computer Vision prevents accidents involving weapons.
