		<h4>Main Problem</h4>
		There were Situations when people get into danger in public locations, some involving weaponry, and resulting in injuries or deaths. People have built visual detection machines or AI image detection programs to prevent these situations from happening and keeping the environment safe. The visual detection machines have been widely used in airports and bus and train stations. In this project, we will be discussing how Computer Vision prevents accidents involving weapons.   

        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        Computer Vision programs for weapon detection can scan baggage, factory machines, etc for contraband in order to keep environments safe. They can use algorithms such as edge detection and deep learning to find contraband in luggages or areas, as well as X-rays. The methods the programs use include model design, feature extraction, auto-border regression, model deployment, and metrics.

        <h4>Previous Similar Projects</h4>
        <p>There were similar projects which were created for computer vision for weapon safety. An example would be, like mentioned before, security checks were operated to scan passengers' luggage for contraband using X-rays, which have average precisions of 99.1% and effectively improves effiency. X-rays can quickly scan passengers' luggages, and reconstruct images according to materials in the luggage. However, judgement and decision making work would be manual, and low security personnel experience, personnel level, and mental state can eventually lead to a disadvantage.
