		<h1> Computer Vision for Weapon Safety </h1>
		<h2> Megan Jen </h2>
		<h4>Main Problem</h4>
		There were Situations when people get into danger in public locations, some involving weaponry, and resulting in injuries or deaths. People have built visual detection machines or AI image detection programs to prevent these situations from happening and keeping the environment safe. The visual detection machines have been widely used in airports and bus and train stations. In this project, we will be discussing how Computer Vision prevents accidents involving weapons.   

        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        Computer Vision programs for weapon detection can scan baggage, factory machines, etc for contraband in order to keep environments safe. They can use algorithms such as edge detection and deep learning to find contraband in luggages or areas, as well as X-rays. The methods the programs use include model design, feature extraction, auto-border regression, model deployment, and metrics.

        <h4>Previous Similar Projects</h4>
        <p>There were similar projects which were created for computer vision for weapon safety. An example would be, like mentioned before, security checks were operated to scan passengers' luggage for contraband using X-rays, which have average precisions of 99.1% and effectively improves effiency. X-rays can quickly scan passengers' luggages, and reconstruct images according to materials in the luggage. However, judgement and decision making work would be manual, and low security personnel experience, personnel level, and mental state can eventually lead to a disadvantage.

        <p> Another similar project were video survailance systems. They have used algorithms such as CNN based SSH and fast RCNN algorithms, with the system playing a role in monitors.

        <h4> Parts to make the machinery work </h4>
            To make the X-rays work on the security checks, an AI recognition system, which won the Gold Award in 2018, was designed to alert and analyze contraband in X-ray images through training. Other similar projects were designed to use deep neural network models to successfully detect various objects in X-ray images, and another recorded project introduced and applied security networking concepts, identification, and information into the direction of intelligent screening. Like so:

	The method of object detection and tracking operates with the dataset being created, trained, and deployed to an object detection algorithm. A suitable detection algorithm gets selected for weapon detection via SSD or fast RCNN. The approach examines and solves the problem using machine-learning models such as RCNN.

	The CNN and RCNN portion of the project has two networks, one to to create relation proposals and other for network for detection. Selective search approach is used to create region proposals, with the RPN network ranking anchors and region boxes.
