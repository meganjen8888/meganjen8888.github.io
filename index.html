		<h1> Computer Vision for Weapon Safety </h1>
		<h2> Megan Jen </h2>
		<h4>Main Problem</h4>
		There were Situations when people get into danger in public locations, some involving weaponry, and resulting in injuries or deaths. People have built visual detection machines or AI image detection programs to prevent these situations from happening and keeping the environment safe. The visual detection machines have been widely used in airports and bus and train stations. In this project, we will be discussing how Computer Vision prevents accidents involving weapons.   

        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        Computer Vision programs for weapon detection can scan baggage, factory machines, etc for contraband in order to keep environments safe. They can use algorithms such as edge detection and deep learning to find contraband in luggages or areas, as well as X-rays. The methods the programs use include model design, feature extraction, auto-border regression, model deployment, and metrics.

        <h4>Previous Similar Projects</h4>
        <p>There were similar projects which were created for computer vision for weapon safety. An example would be, like mentioned before, security checks were operated to scan passengers' luggage for contraband using X-rays, which have average precisions of 99.1% and effectively improves effiency. X-rays can quickly scan passengers' luggages, and reconstruct images according to materials in the luggage. However, judgement and decision making work would be manual, and low security personnel experience, personnel level, and mental state can eventually lead to a disadvantage.

        <p> Another similar project were video survailance systems. They have used algorithms such as CNN based SSH and fast RCNN algorithms, with the system playing a role in monitors.

	One project involving X-rays, an AI recognition system, which won the Gold Award in 2018, was designed to alert and analyze contraband in X-ray images through training. 
	Other similar projects were designed to use deep neural network models and successfully detect various objects in X-ray images, and another recorded project introduced and applied security networking concepts, identification, and information into the direction of intelligent screening. Like so:   <br><img src="airport_detection.png"/>
		
      <h4> Parts to make the machinery work </h4> 
		One part which was used to make computer vision for weapon detection work was the Fast RCNN model. That model was proposed and based on RCNN. This method does not require candidate frames to be included in the Deep Learning model. However, only certain training images are tested in the model, automatically mapping the coordinates at the feature level and speeding up the detection of the model. The accuracy of Fast RCNN on dataset PASCAL-VOC 2007 had overall decently increased in percentage, therefore increasing the efficiency as well.
		The Faster RCNN algorithm was then introduced, and a module called RPN was designed to make the frames required by the training algorithm. An Anchor was also created to extract candidate frames from RPN at various scales. The ‘RPN + Anchor’ approach in the Faster RCNN replaces the Selective Search approach in the original method, which allows the model to be used efficiently and greatly improves the speed.
	SSD, or Single Shot Detection, is also used. 
		Object detection and tracking methods work with datasets being created, trained, and deployed to object detection algorithms. A suitable detection algorithm is chosen for weapon detection. The method would examine and solve the problem, using various machine-learning models such as not only Region Convolutional Neural Network, but also a method called Single Shot Detection.

		Speaking of single shot detection, 
		The fast RCNN model has been used by both security checks and survillence machinery. 
	The CNN and RCNN portion of the project has two networks, one to to create relation proposals and other for network for detection. Selective search approach is used to create region proposals, with the RPN network ranking anchors and region boxes.

		<h4> Positive Results </h4>
		Like stated before, the previous machines have made the environment safer with them scanning multiple X-ray images, and accurately detecting the weapons.
